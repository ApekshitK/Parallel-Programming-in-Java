# Parallel-Programming-in-Java
An introductory course of  parallel Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 

Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
• Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
•	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
•	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
•	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
•	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project implements __ReciprocalArraySum using RecursiveAction's in Java's Fork/Join Framework (Demo)__
2. The Second mini project implements __Analysing Student Statictis Using Java Parallel Stream__
3. The Thrid mini project implements  __Parallelizing Matrix-Matrix Multiply Using Loop Parallelism__
4. The Fourth mini project implements __Using Phasers to Optimize Data-Parallel Applications__
